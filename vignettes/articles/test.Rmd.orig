```{r, include = FALSE}

  collapse = TRUE,

This is an internal reference for creating documentation with images in 
precompiled vignettes.

## Precompile

The precompile script:

```{r, comment = "", echo = FALSE}
readLines(here::here("vignettes/_PRECOMPILE.R")) |>
  cat(sep = "\n")
```

This script pre-compiles vignettes and replaces the figure paths appropriately.\
Note that this *relies* on all figures having alt text and at least a `fig.cap = ""`
as this creates a different style of figure and the replacement therefore works.

All precompiled vignettes also need to define the figure path to be in the 
`vignettes/articles/figures` folder. Provide a suffix as well to prevent 
duplicates.

```
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>",
  # For pre-compiling and pkgdown (relative to pkg home)
  fig.path = "vignettes/articles/figures/suffix_",
  dpi = 150
)
```


## Images: Created in R

>  **Note**: Must use `fig.alt` and set `fig.cap = ""`

```{r, fig.alt = "Two-panel plot visualizing the regional and masked DTM's", fig.cap = ""}
library(naturecounts)
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(data = bcch, aes(x = survey_year)) + 
  geom_bar()
```

## Images: Created elsewhere

- Put the image in the `vignettes/articles/figures_other` folder
- Reference the image from the working directory of the article.

With **`include_graphics()`**

> Use `fig.alt = "Test of birds canada logo", fig.cap = ""`


```{r, fig.alt = "Test of birds canada logo", fig.cap = ""}
include_graphics("figures_other/logo.png")
```

**Directly with markdown: `![]()`**

> **Note:** Use the `\` at the end to ensure that the text is treated as *alt* 
text and not a caption ([ref](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/discussions/9310#discussioncomment-9056156))
