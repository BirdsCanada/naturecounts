\section{NatureCounts account}{

All public data is available with a username/password
(\href{https://www.naturecounts.ca/nc/default/register.jsp}{sign up}
for a free NatureCounts account). However, to access private/semi-public
projects/collections you must request access. See the Access and
\code{request_id}s section for more information.
}

\section{Access and \code{request_id}s}{


Access to a data collection is either available as "full" or "by request".
Use \code{nc_count(username = "USER", show = "all")}, to see the accessibility of
collections.

"Full" access means that data can be immediately downloaded directly through
the \code{naturecounts} R package. "By request" means that a request must be
\href{https://naturecounts.ca/nc/default/searchquery.jsp}{submitted online} and
approved before the data can be downloaded through \code{naturecounts}.

This means that there are two types of data requests: ones made through this
\code{naturecounts} R package (API requests) and those made through the online
\href{https://naturecounts.ca/nc/default/searchquery.jsp}{Web Request Form} (Web
requests). Every request (from either method) generates a \code{request_id} which
identifies the filter set and collections requested. Details of all of
requests can be reviewed with the \code{\link[=nc_requests]{nc_requests()}} function.

To download data with "full" access, users can either specify filters, or if
they are repeating a download, can use the \code{request_id} from \code{\link[=nc_requests]{nc_requests()}}.

Otherwise, if the user doesn't have "full" access, they must supply an
approved \code{request_id} to the \code{\link[=nc_data_dl]{nc_data_dl()}} function (e.g.,
\code{nc_data_dl(request_id = 152000, username = "USER")}). Use \code{\link[=nc_requests]{nc_requests()}} to
see \code{request_id}s, filters, and approval status.

Requests for "full" access to additional collections can be made online
through the \href{https://naturecounts.ca/nc/default/searchquery.jsp}{Web Request Form} by
checking the "Full access?" box in Step 2 of the form.
