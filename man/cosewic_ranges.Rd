\title{Calculate COSEWIC IAO and EOO}
\usage{
cosewic_ranges(
  df_db,
  record_id = "record_id",
  coord_lon = "longitude",
  coord_lat = "latitude",
  species_id = "species_id",
  iao_grid_size_km = 2,
  eoo_p = 0.95,
  filter_unique = FALSE,
  spatial = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df_db}{Either data frame or a connection to database with
\code{naturecounts} table.}

\item{record_id}{Character. Name of the column containing record
identification.}

\item{coord_lon}{Character. Name of the column containing longitude.}

\item{coord_lat}{Character. Name of the column containing latitude.}

\item{species_id}{Character. Name of the column containing species
identification.}

\item{iao_grid_size_km}{Numeric. Size of grid (km) to use when calculating
IAO. Default is COSEWIC requirement (2). Use caution if changing.}

\item{eoo_p}{Numeric. The percentile to calculate the convex hull over.
Defaults to 0.95 for a 95\% convex hull to ensure outlier points do not
artificially inflate the EOO. Note that for a final COSEWIC report, this
may not be appropriate. Set to 1 to include all points.}

\item{filter_unique}{Logical. Whether to filter observations to unique
locations. Use this only if there are too many data points to work with.
This changes the nature of what an observation is, and also may bias
EOO calculations if using less than 100\% of points (see \code{eoo_p}).}

\item{spatial}{Logical. Whether to return sf spatial objects showing
calculations.}
}
\value{
Summarized data frame (ranges) or list containing \code{ranges}, a
summarized data frame, and \code{spatial}, a list of two spatial data frames.

\code{ranges} contains columns
\itemize{
\item \code{n_records_total} - Total number of records used to create ranges
\item \code{min_record} - Minimum number of records within IAO cells
\item \code{max_record} - Maximum number of records within IAO cells
\item \code{median_record} - Median number of records within IAO cells
\item \code{grid_size_km} - IAO cell size (area is this squared)
\item \code{n_occupied} - Number of IAO cells with at least one record
\item \code{iao} - IAO value (\code{grid_size_km}^2 * \code{n_occupied})
\item \code{eoo_pXX} - EOO area calculated with a convex hull at percentile \code{eoo_p}
(e.g., 95\%)
}

\code{spatial} contains spatial data frames
\itemize{
\item \code{iao_sf} - Polygons of the IAO grids with the \code{n_records} per cell
\item \code{eoo_sf} - Polygon of the Convex Hull at percentile \code{eoo_p}
}
}
\description{
The COSEWIC Index of Area of Occupancy (IAO; also called Area of Occupancy,
AOO by the IUCN) and Extent of Occurrence (EOO; IUCN as well) are metrics
used to support status assessments for potentially endangered species.
}
\details{
Note that the while the IUCN calls this metric AOO, in COSEWIC, AOO is actually
a different measure, the \emph{biological} area of occupancy. See the
\href{https://cosewic.ca/index.php/en-ca/reports/preparing-status-reports/instructions-preparing-status-reports.html#Distribution}{Distribution}
section in 'Instructions for preparing COSEWIC status reports'
for more details.

By default the EOO is calculated only using the inner 95\% of points (based on
distance to the centroid). This is to ensure that a first-pass of the EOO
does not reject a species from consideration if there are any outlier
observations. However, for a final COSEWIC assessment report, it is likely
better to carefully explore the data to ensure there are no outliers and then
use the full data set (i.e. set \code{eoo_p = 1}).

The IAO is calculated by first assessing large grids (10x large than the
specified size). Only then are smaller grids created within large grid cells
containing observations. This speeds up the process by avoiding the creation
of grids in areas where there are no observations. This means that the plots
and spatial objects may not have grids over large areas lacking observations.
See examples.
