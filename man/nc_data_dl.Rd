\arguments{
\item{collections}{Character vector. The collection codes from which to
download data. NULL (default) downloads data from all available collections}

\item{project_ids}{Character/Numeric vector. The \verb{project id}s from which to
download data. First the collections associated with a \code{project_id} are
determined, and then data is downloaded for each collection. If both
\code{collections} and \code{project_ids} are supplied, they are combined.}

\item{species}{Numeric vector. Numeric species ids (see details)}

\item{years}{Numeric vector. The start/end years of data to download. Can use
NA for either start or end, or a single value to return data from a single
year.}

\item{doy}{Character/Numeric vector. The start/end day-of-year to download
(1-366 or dates that can be converted to day of year). Can use NA for
either start or end}

\item{region}{List. Named list with \emph{one} of the following options:
\code{country}, \code{statprov}, \code{subnational2}, \code{iba}, \code{bcr}, \code{utm_squares}, \code{bbox}.
See details}

\item{site_type}{Character vector. The type of site to return (e.g., \code{IBA}).}

\item{fields_set}{Character. Set of fields/columns to download. See details.}

\item{fields}{Character vector. If \code{fields_set = custom}, which
fields/columns to download. See details}

\item{username}{Character vector. Username for \url{http://naturecounts.ca}. If
provided, the user will be prompted for a password. If left NULL, only
public collections will be returned.}

\item{info}{Character vector. Short description of reason for the download.
E.g., "COSEWIC report", "Impact Assessment Study", "School project", etc.
This kind of information helps NatureCounts.ca justify the utility of the
database. Required unless resuming/re-downloaded with a \code{request_id}.}

\item{request_id}{Numeric. Specific request id to check or download.}

\item{sql_db}{Character vector. Name and location of SQLite database to
either create or add to}

\item{warn}{Logical. Interactive warning if request more than 1,000,000
records to download.}

\item{timeout}{Numeric. Number of seconds before connecting to the server
times out.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. Show messages?}
}
\value{
Data frame or connection to SQLite database
}
\description{
Download data records from various collections filtered by various options.
In order to ease the load on the server, note that only \strong{three} of
\code{collections}/\code{project_ids}, \code{species}, \code{years}, \code{doy}, \code{region}, and
\code{site_type} can be used in any one request. See the vignette for filtering
your data after download for more options:
\code{vignette("filtering_data", package = "naturecounts")}.
}
\section{NatureCounts account}{

All public data is available with a username/password
(\href{https://www.naturecounts.ca/nc/default/register.jsp}{sign up}
for a free NatureCounts account). However, to access private/semi-public
projects/collections you must request access. See the Access and
\code{request_id}s section for more information.
}

\section{Species ids (\code{species})}{

Numeric species id codes can determined from the functions
\code{\link[=search_species]{search_species()}} or \code{\link[=search_species_code]{search_species_code()}}. See also the article on
\href{https://birdscanada.github.io/naturecounts/articles/species-codes.html}{species codes}
for more information.
}

\section{Day of Year (\code{doy})}{

The format for day of year (\code{doy}) is fairly flexible and can be a whole
number between 1 and 366 or anything recognized by
\code{\link[lubridate]{lubridate-package}}'s \code{\link[lubridate]{ymd}()}
function. However, it must have the order of year, month, day. Note that
year is ignored when converting to day of year, except that it will result
in a 1 day offset for leap years.
}

\section{Regions (\code{region})}{

Regions are defined by codes reflecting the country, state/province,
subnational (level 2), Important Bird Areas (IBA), and Bird Conservation
Regions (BCR) (see \code{\link[=search_region]{search_region()}} for codes). They can also be defined
by providing specific UTM squares to download or a bounding box area which
specifies the min/max longitude and min/max latitude (\code{bbox}). See the
article on \href{http://birdscanada.github.io/naturecounts/articles/region-codes.html}{regional filters}
for more information.
}

\section{Data Fields/Columns (\code{fields_set} and \code{fields})}{

By default data is downloaded with the \code{minimum} set of fields/columns.
However, for more advanced applications, users may wish to specify which
fields/columns to return. The Bird Monitoring Data Exchange (BMDE) schema
keeps track of variables used to augment observation data. There are
different versions reflecting different collections of variables which can
be specified for download in one of four ways:
\enumerate{
\item \code{fields_set} can be a specific shorthand reflecting a BMDE version:
\code{core}, \code{extended} or \code{minimum} (default). See \code{\link[=meta_bmde_versions]{meta_bmde_versions()}} to see
which BMDE version the shorthand refers to.
\item \code{fields_set} can be \code{default} which uses the default BMDE version for a
particular collection (note that if you download more than one collection,
the field sets will expand to cover all fields/columns in the combined
collections)
\item \code{fields_set} can be the exact BMDE version. See \code{\link[=meta_bmde_versions]{meta_bmde_versions()}}
for options.
\item \code{fields_set} can be \code{custom} and the \code{fields} argument can be a
character vector specifying the exact fields/columns to return. See
\code{\link[=meta_bmde_fields]{meta_bmde_fields()}}) for potential \code{fields} values.
}

Note that in all cases there are a set of fields/columns that are \emph{always}
returned, no matter what \code{fields_set} is used.
}

\section{Access and \code{request_id}s}{


Access to a data collection is either available as "full" or "by request".
Use \code{nc_count(username = "USER", show = "all")}, to see the accessibility of
collections.

"Full" access means that data can be immediately requested directly through
the \code{naturecounts} R package. "By request" means that a request must be
\href{https://naturecounts.ca/nc/default/searchquery.jsp}{submitted online} and
approved before the data can be downloaded through \code{naturecounts}.

This means that there are two types of data requests: ones made through this
\code{naturecounts} R package (API requests) and those made through the online
\href{https://naturecounts.ca/nc/default/searchquery.jsp}{Web Request Form} (Web
requests). Every request (from either method) generates a \code{request_id} which
identifies the filter set and collections requested. Details of all of
requests can be reviewed with the \code{\link[=nc_requests]{nc_requests()}} function.

To download data with "full" access, users can either specify filters, or if
they are repeating a download, can use the \code{request_id} from \code{\link[=nc_requests]{nc_requests()}}.

Otherwise, if the user doesn't have "full" access, they must supply an
approved \code{request_id} to the \code{\link[=nc_data_dl]{nc_data_dl()}} function (e.g.,
\code{nc_data_dl(request_id = 152000, username = "USER")}). Use \code{\link[=nc_requests]{nc_requests()}} to
see \code{request_id}s, filters, and approval status.

Requests for "full" access to additional collections can be made online
through the \href{https://naturecounts.ca/nc/default/searchquery.jsp}{Web Request Form} by
checking the "Full access?" box in Step 2 of the form.
